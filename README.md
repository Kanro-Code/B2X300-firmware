## Marlin 1.1
## Production extruder test branch

This branch allows the test of the B2X300 extruder. The test should automatically start once the machine is enabled.

This test verifies:
- Correct heating of both extruders
- Correct extruder position (E1 left, E2 right)
- Tests blower

Ensure the bed thermistor is in contact with the left side block, E1 to allow the correct test to be executed
